pygaarst-scripts
================

This is a collection of useful scripts carrying out operations on geospatial and remote sensing data, some using the pygaarst library, some stand-alone.

Types of scripts
----------------

Scripts in scripts/ depend on pygaarst, those in standalone-scripts/ do not, but will depend on other Python libraries, such as gdal, pyproj, fiona...

Requirements
------------

pygaarst-scripts is written to run under Python 2.7 on a *nix environment. Linux, OS X or BSD should work equally well. Not tested under Windows. 

Python 3 support is planned but requires pygaarst to be ported to Python 3 first.
